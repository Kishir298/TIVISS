# T.I.V.I.S.S. - Though I'm Vanquished, I'm Still Stronger

**T.I.V.I.S.S.** is an independent AI agent within the **R.I.S.A.R.M.S.** ecosystem.

## What is T.I.V.I.S.S.?

T.I.V.I.S.S. stands for **"Though I'm Vanquished, I'm Still Stronger"**.

It is a separate AI agent designed to eventually be handed over to another
person. Because of that, it is architected around an independent identity,
configuration, memory, permission model, ownership model, and lifecycle --
with a controlled handover mechanism at its core.

Current implementation status: **foundation phase (v0.1.0)**.

## Why is it separate from A.S.I.S.?

A.S.I.S. ("A Smart Intelligence System") is the primary intelligence system
of R.I.S.A.R.M.S. T.I.V.I.S.S. is **not** A.S.I.S.:

- T.I.V.I.S.S. has its own architecture and is not a copy or rename of A.S.I.S.
- T.I.V.I.S.S. owns its own identity, memory, permissions, and ownership.
- T.I.V.I.S.S. does not import A.S.I.S. internals and is not dependent on A.S.I.S.

## Relationship with C.O.R.E.

C.O.R.E. ("Communication, Organization and Resource Engine") is the central
ecosystem management engine. T.I.V.I.S.S. is designed to integrate with
C.O.R.E. later through an adapter, but does **not** depend on a running C.O.R.E.

## Relationship with R.E.S.C.S.

R.E.S.C.S. ("Rishik's Efficient System for Cloud Storage") is the cloud
storage system of the ecosystem. T.I.V.I.S.S. defines a memory abstraction and
will integrate with R.E.S.C.S. later through an adapter. R.E.S.C.S. is **not**
bundled inside T.I.V.I.S.S. and is not required for development.

## Ownership and handover purpose

T.I.V.I.S.S.'s defining characteristic is that it can eventually be handed
over to a new owner through a controlled, validated, and auditable process.

This version defines the ownership state model, the handover request state
machine, and the audit events. Real-world transfer is intentionally **not**
implemented yet.

## Testing

Tests are offline and deterministic; no external services are required.

```text
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
```

## Usage

```text
.venv\Scripts\python -m tiviss --help
.venv\Scripts\python -m tiviss --message "hello"
.venv\Scripts\python -m tiviss          # interactive REPL (tiviss> )
```

The REPL drives the real pipeline (permissions → provider → memory).
`/help`, `/status`, `/clear`, `/quit` are built in.

## Storage domains

TIVISS cloud data lives under `tiviss.*` RESCS namespaces
(`tiviss.memory`, `tiviss.conversations`, ...); see
`../RESCS/docs/storage-domains.md`. The HTTP client refuses other
namespaces unless explicitly allowed. `asis.*` and `personal.*` are
never touched.

## Future integrations

- C.O.R.E.: register agent, report health, publish events, route messages
- R.E.S.C.S.: persistent memory via the memory backend interface
- A.S.I.S.: interoperability without shared internals
- Real owner handover workflows

## Development rules

- T.I.V.I.S.S. does not modify other R.I.S.A.R.M.S. repositories.
- T.I.V.I.S.S. does not depend on a running C.O.R.E., R.E.S.C.S., or A.S.I.S.
- No hard-coded secrets; configuration comes from validated settings + env vars.
- Security boundaries are explicit; integration boundaries are treated as untrusted.
